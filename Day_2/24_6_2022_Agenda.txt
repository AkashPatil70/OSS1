

	Good morning all of  you.
	Welcome to Dotnet Learning

	Day 2:
		Agenda

			Learning programming using C# Syntax
			.NET Framework
			Learn by doing not by just listening

			Let us use music, video, conversation for building skill for .net fullStack.

			Yes you could develop complete IT solution as fullStack solution using .NET


		Yesterday we learn 
				What is .net
				Why .net
				How you could think .net as your one more fullstack Development platform

		C# language is language
				consist of 
					Power of C
					Smartness of C++
					Simplicity of Java
					and elegance of VB



		So Are you ready to explore the world of .net from Micrsoft Certified Trainer ??????????????????????
		
		Let us learn together.



		Extension for files

		.sln----------------------Visual Studio Solution file
		.csproj-------------------Visual Studio Project file
		.config------------------Application configuration file ( settings)
		.cs----------------------CSharp Source Code file

		


Compilation process of .net Application

Console Application project type:

 soruce code------------CSC.exe-------------------->   .Exe ( Self Executable file)------------Assembly
(CSharp Compiler)


Class Library project type:

soruce code------------CSC.exe-------------------->   .dll ( Dynamic Link Library)-------------Assembly
									     ( Dependencies)
		(CSharp Compiler)

  (.cs file)
  (CSharp Syntax)---------------------------------->   IL Code ( Intermediate Language Code) ( MSIL Code)

Assembly:
	 a logical unit of deployment  to .net platform
	 using exe as well dll files



Execution of .net Application
			
When application is submitted for execution :

		1.Operating System will create a process
		2.Operating System will assign primary Thread for process to exeuctte  code available in exe.
		3..net runtime will be loaded into process , that is called as CLR (Common Language Runtime)  ( like JVM)
		4. CLR consist of 
				  Assembly Loader
				  Code Verifier
				  Just In Time compiler (JIT)
				  Garbage Collector
		5.CLR will convert IL code into Native Code using JIT.

		6.Garbage Collector( GC) takes care of Automatic Memory management for aplication under exeuction (Process)
			Mark and Sweep algorithm is used by Garbage Collector

	Keep it Simple and Stupid
